## Running Guide
See below for a quickstart guide:

1. Place `forest_fire.py` in the ca_descriptions folder of your CAPyLE installation
2. Run CAPyLE
2. Use the menu bar to select File -> Open. This will open in the folder `./ca_descriptions`.
3. Open the file;
  - `forest_fire.py` which is the file for this assignment
3. Set you desired generations and save the configuration to run the simulation (around 2000 is recommended to view the fire reaching the town)

## Testing
All parameters for testing and altering the program are provided as global variables that the user can change at the top of `forest_fire.py`

## Acknowledgements
The system is based on the code for CAPyLE Game of Life made by Peter Worsley.
